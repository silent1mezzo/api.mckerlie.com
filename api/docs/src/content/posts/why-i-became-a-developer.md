When I was in grade 9 I wanted to be a lawyer. I didn’t really know what that entailed and I had no idea how many more years of schooling I’d have to complete to realize my dream. In grade 10 I took my first law class and absolutely hated my teacher. From that moment on I knew I would never become a lawyer. I dropped out of law class and took computer science and fell in love. Over the years I’ve learnt more and more and I thought I’d take a few minutes to talk about “Why I Became a Developer”.

## Problem Solving
For as long as I can remember I’ve loved solving puzzles. When I would get a new puzzle I’d try to break it down to smaller logical chunks to try to see how the puzzle worked. That’s exactly what I get to do at work every day. I first start with a large overarching problem that’s given to me by a customer and then I have to break it down into smaller logical chunks. Sometimes these problems aren’t exciting or challenging. I’ve written enough  [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)  websites that they no longer give challenges but sometimes these problems are unique and fun.

## Building Stuff
While I love solving problems and it’s fun to have a challenging career I really enjoy building things. As a kid I was always taking stuff apart, finding out how it worked and then building it back. Writing software provides me with quick gratification because I can see the immediate results of my work. I can quickly put together a new app and once deployed see it being used instantly on the Internet.

Being a developer also lets me build a large range of things. I can build a website one day, an iPhone app another and configure a server on the weekend. This diversity allows a developer to feel new and exciting even if you’ve done it for a few decades.

## Continuous Learning
As a developer, if you’re not learning the latest technology you get left behind very quickly. There’s always a new language coming out or a new framework to read about. While this can become overwhelming at first I often find trying a new language out to be a  [fun experiment](https://tech.gadventures.com/we-taught-a-neural-network-to-write-a-blog-6463f619ac4c)  on a day off. I’ve also found that this constant learning makes programming stay fresh and fun.

I’ve since been promoted to  [Manager](/posts/from-developer-to-manager/)  and now a Director but I think these concepts still ring true, just at a different scale. While I don’t directly build applications and websites anymore I get to build more things by building an amazing team. I’d love to hear why you became a developer. Let me know in the comments below.
