For the better part of the last decade, I've been an Engineering Manager (EM) and Director of Engineering (DoE). I've learnt a number of ways that don't work when it comes to leading people and a few ways that do and I'd like to share them with you. A few weeks ago one of my co-workers asked me what it was like getting into management. As I reflected on that question I realized it was one I've answered before. I figured that if I can help even one person navigate the waters of management then this website will be worth it.

My [path to management](https://mckerlie.com/posts/from-developer-to-manager) started as it does for a number of engineers. I spent the first 5 years of my career as an Individual Contributor (IC) migrating legacy systems, building out large websites and working in both healthcare and travel. One day my boss gave his two weeks and I got an unexpected promotion into management. It took me almost 18 months before I really enjoyed being a manager. It took me a long time to realize how I provided value to the company, how to help my engineers grow and even if I wanted to be a manager in the first place. Since that fateful day I first stepped into management I've learnt a lot. I've learnt how to have better 1:1s, how to navigate work politics, how to plan multi-department projects and more and I'd love to share them with you.

So what can you expect from this site? I'm going to be writing at least once a month and I've already written the first years worth of content. I've got a few series of posts that will dive deeper into things like getting into management and onboarding new staff that I'm excited to share.
