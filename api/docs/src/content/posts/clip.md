## Quick Start
You can get started with clip quickly by typing `clip` in your terminal to pull up the help text.

Here are a few commands you can try out

**Creating a List**
```
$ clip <list_name> # Creates one if it doesn't exist
$ clip websites
```

**Viewing a List:**
```
$ clip <list_name> # If a list exists, view it
$ clip websites
```

**Adding a snippet:**
```
$ clip <list_name>
$ clip websites django3.0 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/releases/3.0/
```

**Getting a snippet:**
```
$ clip <list_name>
$ clip websites django3.0 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/releases/3.0/
`https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/releases/3.0/` has been copied to your clipboard
```

You can also omit the list_name and itâ€™ll try to find the key
```
$ clip django3.0 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/releases/3.0/
`https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/releases/3.0/` has been copied to your clipboard
```

**Deleting a List/Key**
```
$ clip delete <list_name>
$ clip delete websites
 
$ clip delete <list_name> <key>
$ clip delete websites django3.0
```

**Opening a snippet in your browser:**
```
$ clip open <list_name>
$ clip open websites django3.0
 
$ clip open 
$ clip open django3.0
```
